# üîå USB Boot Drive Removal Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Safe USB Removal After NVMe Migration

This guide walks you through safely removing the USB boot drive after successfully migrating Home Assistant to NVMe storage.

---

## üìã Pre-Removal Checklist

### ‚úÖ Verify NVMe Boot Success
Before removing the USB drive, confirm these critical items:

1. **System is booting from NVMe**:
   ```bash
   # Check current boot device
   df -h /
   # Should show /dev/nvme0n1p* (not /dev/sda*)
   ```

2. **Home Assistant is fully functional**:
   - Web interface accessible at http://192.168.0.166:8123
   - All integrations loading properly
   - AI integrations working correctly
   - Voice processing functional

3. **Multiple successful reboots**:
   ```bash
   # Test reboot from NVMe (do this 2-3 times)
   sudo reboot
   ```

4. **No USB dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Verify no critical files on USB
   lsblk
   mount | grep sda
   ```

## üñ•Ô∏è Removal Procedure

### Step 1: Access Intel NUC BIOS
1. **Power down** the Home Assistant system completely
2. **Press and hold F2** during startup to enter BIOS
3. Navigate to **Boot** settings

### Step 2: Verify Boot Order
1. **Check boot priority**:
   - NVMe SSD should be **first** in boot order
   - USB drive should be **lower priority** or disabled
2. **Confirm UEFI settings**:
   - Boot mode: UEFI (not Legacy)
   - Secure Boot: Enabled if desired

### Step 3: Physical USB Removal
1. **Power down completely** (not just reboot)
2. **Disconnect power cable** from NUC
3. **Remove USB drive** from port
4. **Reconnect power** and boot

### Step 4: Verify Clean Boot
1. **Monitor boot process**:
   - Should boot directly to Home Assistant
   - No USB-related errors
   - Normal startup time (~2-3 minutes)

2. **Test all functions**:
   - Web interface: http://192.168.0.166:8123
   - SSH access: `ssh bibin@192.168.0.166`
   - AI integrations: Test voice commands
   - All devices and automations

## üß™ Post-Removal Testing

### Test 1: System Stability
```bash
# Run for 24 hours minimum
uptime
# Check system logs for errors
journalctl -f
```

### Test 2: AI Integration Functionality
```yaml
# Test all three AI providers
service: script.ai_model_comparison
data:
  query: "Verify system is working after USB removal"
```

### Test 3: Voice Processing
- Test wake word: "Hey Assistant"
- Test TTS: Voice responses working
- Test STT: Voice commands recognized

### Test 4: Performance Validation
```bash
# Check NVMe performance
sudo hdparm -t /dev/nvme0n1
# Should show ~400+ MB/sec

# Check boot time
systemd-analyze
# Should be significantly faster than USB
```

## üîÑ NVMe Performance Benefits

### Before (USB Boot)
- **Boot Time**: 5-8 minutes
- **Read Speed**: 20-50 MB/s
- **Write Speed**: 10-30 MB/s
- **Random I/O**: Very slow
- **System Response**: Sluggish

### After (NVMe Boot)
- **Boot Time**: 2-3 minutes
- **Read Speed**: 400-2000 MB/s
- **Write Speed**: 300-1500 MB/s
- **Random I/O**: Excellent
- **System Response**: Snappy

## üõ°Ô∏è Backup Strategy (Post-USB)

### Create New Backup System
Since USB is removed, establish new backup procedures:

#### 1. Network Backups
```bash
# Create automated backup script
sudo nano /homeassistant/scripts/backup.sh

#!/bin/bash
# Backup to network location
rsync -av /homeassistant/ user@backup-server:/ha-backups/$(date +%Y%m%d)/
```

#### 2. Cloud Backups
```yaml
# Add to configuration.yaml
backup:
  auto_backup: true
  backup_location: "/backup"
  keep_days: 30
```

#### 3. External Storage
- Use external USB/SSD for periodic backups
- **Do not** use for permanent storage
- Rotate backup drives monthly

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Emergency Recovery Plan

### If NVMe Fails After USB Removal

#### Option 1: Restore from Backup
1. **New NVMe/SSD**: Install fresh storage
2. **Boot from USB**: Use Home Assistant OS installer USB
3. **Restore**: Deploy from backup
4. **Reconfigure**: Apply this AI setup

#### Option 2: Cloud Recovery
1. **Download configurations**: From this Git repository
2. **Fresh install**: On new storage
3. **Apply configs**: Copy all files from repository
4. **Add API keys**: Configure secrets.yaml

#### Option 3: Snapshot Recovery
```bash
# If using Home Assistant snapshots
# Boot from installer USB
# Restore latest snapshot
```

## üìä Performance Monitoring

### Monitor NVMe Health
```bash
# Check NVMe status
sudo nvme list
sudo nvme smart-log /dev/nvme0n1

# Monitor disk usage
df -h
iostat -x 1
```

### Set Up Alerts
```yaml
# Add to configuration.yaml
sensor:
  - platform: systemmonitor
    resources:
      - type: disk_use_percent
        arg: /
  - platform: command_line
    name: "NVMe Temperature"
    command: "sudo nvme smart-log /dev/nvme0n1 | grep temperature"
```

## üéØ Post-Removal Optimization

### Storage Optimization
```bash
# Clean up unnecessary files
sudo apt autoremove
sudo apt autoclean

# Check for large log files
sudo du -sh /var/log/*
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=7d
```

### Performance Tuning
```yaml
# Add to configuration.yaml for NVMe optimization
recorder:
  purge_keep_days: 7
  exclude:
    domains:
      - updater
    entities:
      - sensor.date_time
```
